Objectives
Work with a client to create a website that will benefit them the most

Contributions
My main contributions were helping with the mustache files or anything similar to an HTML file while also helping find solutions when things didn't want to work correctly.

Challenges
The challenges I faced were extrememly basic. They were the ones that are so simple that you feel dumb when you find out why things aren't working the way you want them too. We also had a problem with bootstrap because we were using two different versions.

Incomplete
One key feature that we didn't complete was the admin log in. It would have been nice to add in, but we ran out of time.

Reflection
I think communication would need to be improved on. We were pretty good about communicating towards the end, but at the beginning it was a little rough.
